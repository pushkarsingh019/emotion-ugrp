## Emotion UGRP

The following files contain experiments made for an undergraduate research project to understand the role of emotions on self-prioritisation effect (SPE).
The experiments are made using the popular, open-source software package named Psychopy.

### About the experiments

The experiments in this repositiory deploy the paradigm of shape-label matching task to understand if high arousal emotional distractors affect the bias for self as outlines in self-priotitisation effect.
The final files are GroupA_final.psyexp and GroupB_final.psyexp. The two files counterbalance for shapes and labels.
